- 👋 Hi, I’m @RickLearn


- 👀 I’m interested in coding R for data analysis purposes, as an aspiring scientist. A student in cognitive science, looking to learn the statistics and 
     coding side of my field to a level beyond what most do, and to have an edge in that area. That said, I'm still at the beginning and have a long way to go. 


- 🌱 I’m currently learning R.


- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on, anything I can. I don't have much to offer yet, but if I can get the skills I'd be wanting to share them.


- 📫 How to reach me: 
        By a message or email (just creating this now, I'll edit it later, so if there's no dm system I'll leave my email here).
